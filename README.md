# Project-Spotfy
A Spotfy clone created with the Bootstrap framework. Common web structure languages (HTML and CSS) and the Mobile-First concept. I exercised the idea of responsive layout already present in Bootstrap 4. The mobile first is the ability to adapt to different devices. And this was my first little project.
